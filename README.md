### Installation of the Dive Into Ansible Docker Desktop Extension

The Docker Desktop extension framework is currently in Beta and therefore, these instructions will change as this matures into the Stable release cycle. 

In the future, you'll be able to execute the commands ```docker extension``` by default but, at the moment this requires manual configuration.

Download the docker-extension binary from https://github.com/docker/extensions-sdk/releases/tag/v0.2.4 and then configure as a plugin using the steps outlined here - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/extensions-sdk/#prerequisites (essentially, moving the docker-extension file to ~/.docker/cli-plugins).

Once complete, from this repository you should be able to execute the following to install and uninstall the extension -

#### If you wish to build the extension yourself (this can be skipped and instead it will pull my hosted version on Docker Hub)
```
make build-extension
# or alternatively, if you haven't got make run: docker build --tag=spurin/diveintoansible-extension:latest . 
```

#### Installation
```
docker extension install spurin/diveintoansible-extension:latest
```

#### Removal
```
docker extension uninstall spurin/diveintoansible-extension:latest
```
